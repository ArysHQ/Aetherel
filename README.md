Aetherel is a new, full-stack Golang web library.
It makes strict choices for dependencies, reducing both the options and boilerplate for you as a developer, and allowing you to focus on your actual business logic.

Aetherel is currently in development, expect bugs and do not use any of this in production.

The technologies used in Aetherel are:
- echo server
- templ templating engine
- postgresql database
- goose migrations
- sqlc database queries

Coming soon (technologies subject to change):
- HTMX
- Svelte components for high interactivity
- Stripe payment integration
- Plausible analytics
- PostHog A/B testing and feature flags
